curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```
Expected: `{"status":"healthy","services":{...}}`

### 2. Verify Frontend is Running
```bash
# Open simple.html version
open http://localhost:5173/simple.html
```

### 3. Have Sample Questions Ready
Copy these into a text file for easy paste during demo:

1. **Compare rice production in Punjab and West Bengal**
2. **What are the rainfall patterns in Maharashtra?**
3. **Show me wheat production trends over the years**
4. **Which states have the highest agricultural prices?**

---

## 🎥 Recording Setup (2-MINUTE VIDEO)

### Tools Needed
- **Loom** (https://www.loom.com) - Sign up for free
- **Browser Tab**: http://localhost:5173/simple.html
- **Code Editor**: Show backend folder structure briefly

### Window Preparation
1. Close unnecessary browser tabs
2. Clean up desktop (remove personal files from view)
3. Open Terminal with backend running (to show it's live)
4. Have simple.html in browser ready to record

## 📝 RECORDING SCRIPT (Exactly 2 Minutes)

### [0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION (20 seconds)
**SAY:**
> "Hi! I'm presenting Project Samarth - an intelligent Q&A system for Indian agricultural and climate data. This system uses RAG architecture with GPT-4 to answer natural language questions about real government datasets from data.gov.in. Let me show you how it works."

**SHOW:**
- Simple.html interface on screen
- Point to the question input box

---

### [0:20-1:10] LIVE DEMO (50 seconds)
**DO:**
1. **Paste Question 1:** "Compare rice production in Punjab and West Bengal"
2. **Click "Ask Question"**
3. **WHILE WAITING (~25 seconds):**
   - SAY: "The system is now retrieving data from 5 different government datasets, using semantic search with OpenAI embeddings, and generating a comprehensive answer with GPT-4."
4. **WHEN ANSWER APPEARS:**
   - SAY: "Look at this detailed response with source citations from the actual government datasets."
   - Scroll through the answer
   - Point to the citations at the bottom

**Optional if time permits:**
5. Ask one more quick question to show consistency

---

### [1:10-1:40] ARCHITECTURE (30 seconds)
**SAY:**
> "Let me quickly show you the architecture behind this."

**SHOW:** (Switch to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md or briefly show backend folder)
- SAY: "The backend uses FastAPI with a RAG pipeline"
- SAY: "We have 5 real datasets totaling 6,820 rows of government data"
- SAY: "ChromaDB for vector storage with OpenAI embeddings"
- SAY: "GPT-4 for natural language generation with citation extraction"

**SHOW:** Terminal with backend running
- SAY: "Everything runs locally and can scale to cloud deployment"

---

### [1:40-2:00] WRAP-UP (20 seconds)
**SAY:**
> "What makes this unique is:
> - Real government data integration
> - Accurate source citations for every answer
> - Fast response times under 30 seconds
> - Production-ready API architecture
> - Multi-dataset semantic search
> 
> This system can help farmers, policymakers, and researchers access agricultural insights instantly. Thank you!"

**SHOW:** Back to simple.html with answer visible

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Backend Not Responding During Recording
```bash
# Restart backend
cd /Users/mayursantoshtarate/Desktop/Apperentice/backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### If Answer Takes Too Long (>40 seconds)
- **DON'T PANIC** - Explain it's doing semantic search
- Say: "This shows the system is actually processing real data, not fake responses"
- Use the wait time to explain the architecture

### If You Make a Mistake
- **Pause recording** in Loom
- **Re-record that section**
- Loom allows editing!
