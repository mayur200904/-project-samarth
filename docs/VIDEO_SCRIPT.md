# 🎥 Project Samarth - 2 Minute Video Script

## [0:00-0:15] Introduction & Problem Statement

**Visual**: Show data.gov.in portal, multiple datasets
**Narration**:
> "Government portals like data.gov.in host thousands of valuable datasets, but they're fragmented across ministries with different formats, making insights difficult. Project Samarth solves this."

**On Screen**: 
- data.gov.in portal screenshot
- Show different dataset formats (CSV, XLS, JSON)
- Text overlay: "Problem: Fragmented data, inconsistent formats"

## [0:15-0:45] Live Demo - The "WOW" Moment

**Visual**: Screen recording of the chat interface
**Narration**:
> "Watch this. I'll ask: 'Compare rice production in Punjab and West Bengal over the last 5 years with rainfall patterns.' The system automatically identifies relevant datasets, fetches the data, correlates climate with agriculture, and provides a comprehensive answer with full source citations."

**On Screen Actions**:
1. Type the question in chat
2. Show loading animation with "Analyzing data sources..."
3. Answer appears with:
   - Statistical comparison
   - Correlation insights
   - Source citations with clickable links
   - Confidence score
4. Click on a citation to show dataset link

**Highlight**: 
- Processing time: ~4 seconds
- Multiple data sources synthesized
- Every claim cited

## [0:45-1:15] Technical Deep Dive - Architecture

**Visual**: Split screen - Code + Architecture Diagram
**Narration**:
> "Here's how it works: We use a RAG architecture with vector embeddings for semantic search. When a query comes in, an LLM decomposes it, identifies required datasets, fetches data through our data.gov.in integration layer, and synthesizes answers with complete traceability."

**On Screen**:
1. Show `query_engine.py` - query decomposition code
2. Show `rag_service.py` - vector search
3. Show `data_fetcher.py` - data.gov.in integration
4. Show architecture diagram with data flow highlighted

**Code Snippets to Show** (5-second each):
```python
# Query Decomposition
decomposition = await llm_service.decompose_query(user_query)

# Semantic Search  
relevant_datasets = rag_service.find_relevant_datasets(query)

# Data Synthesis
answer, citations = await llm_service.generate_answer(...)
```

## [1:15-1:45] Key Differentiators

**Visual**: Quick feature montage
**Narration**:
> "What makes this stand out? First, it's production-ready with comprehensive error handling, async operations, and horizontal scalability. Second, complete privacy - deployable in air-gapped environments with local LLMs. Third, real-time data integration from live government APIs. And fourth, every answer is traceable to its source dataset."

**On Screen** (rapid showcase):
1. **Production Code**: Show type hints, error handling, logging
2. **Privacy**: Show Ollama local LLM configuration
3. **Real-time Integration**: Show data refresh button, cache management  
4. **Traceability**: Show citation system, dataset explorer

**Text Overlays**:
- "✅ Production-Grade Code"
- "🔒 Privacy-First Design"
- "🔄 Real-Time Data Integration"
- "📊 Complete Traceability"

## [1:45-2:00] Wrap-up & Impact

**Visual**: Show multiple example questions being answered rapidly
**Narration**:
> "From comparative analysis to policy recommendations, Project Samarth transforms how we interact with agricultural data. It's extensible, scalable, and ready for real-world deployment to help policymakers make better data-driven decisions."

**On Screen**:
- Show 3-4 different questions answered in rapid succession:
  1. Trend analysis
  2. District comparison
  3. Climate correlation
  4. Policy recommendation

**Final Frame**:
```
