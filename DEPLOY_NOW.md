## 🚀 DEPLOY NOW (Takes 2 Minutes!)

### Step 1: Open Netlify Drop
I've opened this for you: **https://app.netlify.com/drop**

(If not open, click that link)

### Step 2: Drag the `dist` Folder
1. Open Finder
2. Go to: `/Users/mayursantoshtarate/Desktop/Apperentice/frontend/`
3. **Drag the `dist` folder** onto the Netlify Drop page
4. Wait 30 seconds

### Step 3: Get Your URL!
You'll get a URL like: `https://amazing-name-123.netlify.app`

**That's it! Your app is deployed! 🎉**

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployed App

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: For LOCAL Testing Only
The current build connects to `http://localhost:8000`

This means:
- ✅ Works on YOUR computer (where backend runs)
- ❌ Won't work from other devices/locations

To test:
1. Make sure your backend is running:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/mayursantoshtarate/Desktop/Apperentice/backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Open your Netlify URL on THIS computer
3. Ask a question!

## 🌐 For TRUE Remote Access (Anyone Can Use It)

If you want ANYONE to access it from ANY device, you need to:

### Option A: Deploy Backend Too (Recommended for Production)
Deploy backend to Railway/Render, then rebuild frontend with new URL

### Option B: Use Ngrok (Quick Demo)
1. Sign up at https://ngrok.com (free)
2. Run: `ngrok http 8000`
3. Update frontend API URL to ngrok URL
4. Rebuild and redeploy

---

## 📋 Quick Commands Reference

### Check if backend is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

### Rebuild frontend (if needed):
```bash
cd /Users/mayursantoshtarate/Desktop/Apperentice/frontend
npm run build
```

### Open dist folder:
```bash
open /Users/mayursantoshtarate/Desktop/Apperentice/frontend/dist
```

## ✅ What You Have Now

After dragging to Netlify:
- ✅ Public URL (shareable link)
- ✅ HTTPS (secure)
- ✅ Fast CDN
- ✅ Works on YOUR computer (with backend running)
- ⚠️ Only accessible from your computer currently

---

## 🎬 For Your Demo Video

You can:
1. **Use the deployed Netlify URL** (on your computer)
2. **Or use http://localhost:5173/simple.html** (simpler, same thing)

Both will work perfectly for your demo since you're recording on your computer!
