3. **Technology**: RAG architecture, multi-LLM support
4. **Demo**: Working end-to-end query
5. **Uniqueness**: Privacy-first, production-ready, traceable

### In Documentation
1. System architecture diagram
2. Technology stack and rationale
3. Scalability considerations
4. Security and privacy features
5. Future enhancements

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Backend Won't Start
- Check `.env` file exists and has API key
- Verify Python version (3.10+)
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check logs for specific errors

### Frontend Won't Build
- Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check Node version (18+)
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

### Slow Response Times
- First query is always slower (loading datasets)
- Use gpt-3.5-turbo instead of gpt-4 for faster responses
- Or use Ollama locally

### "No datasets found"
- Backend is starting up (wait 30 seconds)
- Check backend logs
- Verify data directory permissions
